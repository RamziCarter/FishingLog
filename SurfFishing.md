## Fishing Log

> For the 2024 season I picked up a few lures and will try to improve my catch with certain tactics
- using bucktails for searching out fish will be my main tactic for looking for striped bass
  - there is a limitation to using bucktails due to the lack of casting distance.
  - will need to pick up some black and red bucktails 3/4 oz, 1 oz, 1-1/2 oz, 2oz
  - more bait strip trailers
- using poppers or some sort of topwater will improve my catch of larger stripers I am sure
  - the only extremely large striper I caught in 2023 from the surf was on a top water bait
- I have picked up 4 needle fish plugs and 2 little neck swimmers
  terminal tackle is not an issue and the gear seems to also be okay
- may have to find a pair of wading boots or crocks to wear
